<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I'am an asian girl living in Oslo, Norway for over 7 years now. I'm from northern part of the Philippines and
  I'm a nurse by profession and i love my work!
  I think nurse is a noble job, and its my joy to help people who are in need and sick.

 <p>But lately, I had this feeling that there is something missing. I began to get bored and unhappy with my 
  everyday tasks at work and it seemed like i wanted to pursue other career.</p>

<p>Coding got my attention and i think its a cool job. It hones problem solving and analysis skills, 
  such as finding errors and thinking logically, and that's what I truly need to challenge my brain, because 
  it feels like it was stuck for a long time. Being a developer requires logical thinking and creativeness, so i need activities
  like this to activate and enhance my brain.</p>
  
<p>Im a patient type, I dont give up easily, and I think that is a very important aspect that is in need 
  to be applied not only at work but to our everyday life. 
  Success dont come overnight, lots of effort and work need to be inserted into it, so i think patient, 
  determination and dedication are important elements to succeed.</p>

 <p>Im excited to pursue this career, as we advancing in technology, I know that being a web developer is a in
  demand jobb all over the world. Can't wait to learn and explore more!
